	My primary academic interests lie in Software Verification, particularly in Static Analysis by Abstract Interpretation. During my internship, I worked on integrating the PPLite (\url{https://github.com/ezaffanella/PPLite}) library into the Mopsa (\url{https://mopsa.lip6.fr/}) static analyzer, further enhancing my practical experience and technical skills in this field. My bachelorâ€™s thesis focused on evaluating the quality of source code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) through static analysis.
