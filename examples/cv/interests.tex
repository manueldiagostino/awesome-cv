    My primary academic interests lie in Software Verification, particularly in Static Analysis by Abstract Interpretation. I am currently engaged in the development of a static analyzer for the R programming language. This practical work builds upon my previous experience, which includes an internship where I worked on integrating the PPLite library into the Mopsa static analyzer, further enhancing my technical skills in this field. My bachelor’s thesis also focused on evaluating the quality of source code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) through static analysis.
