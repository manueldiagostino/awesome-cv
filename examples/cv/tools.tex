        {Tree-sitter grammar for StrictDoc}
        {From June 2025}
        {
            A Tree-sitter grammar for the StrictDoc language. This tool enables
            robust and efficient parsing of StrictDoc files, allowing for
            features like syntax highlighting, code navigation, and structural
            analysis in compatible text editors and IDEs. The grammar is
            designed to work with the Tree-sitter parsing framework, improving
            the developer experience when working with StrictDoc requirements
            files

        {Deep Neural Network Library}
        {From May 2024}
        {
            A flexible C++ library for building, training, and using deep neural
            networks. Modular, easy-to-use, and high-performance. The library
            supports various neural network architectures, efficient training
            tools, and robust inference methods
            (\url{https://github.com/unipr-org/deep-neural-network}).
