	{From Jan. 2024}
	{ \textbf{Principal Investigator}: Prof. Vincenzo Arceri. The goal of the project is to conduct an extensive quality and safety evaluation of the code generated with some of the most popular and open‑source LLMs employing static analyzers, that can detect vulnerabilities and run‑time errors statically, without executing the code. Once this information is available, it will be included in the code‑generation task, to guide the LLM itself to produce a more precise and safe output, in which static analysis is somehow introduced in the pipeline of the code‑generation task. }
